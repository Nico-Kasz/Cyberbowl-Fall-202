### **Common Name:**

Microsoft Windows MSHTML Platform Spoofing Vulnerability

### **Overview:**

CVE-43461 refers to a vulnerability within the MSHTML (Trident) platform used by Microsoft Windows, specifically in handling crafted web content. The vulnerability exists because the MSHTML engine can be tricked into improperly interpreting and displaying certain web-based content, leading to **URL spoofing** or **content spoofing**.

Attackers could exploit this flaw by crafting a malicious website or embedding malicious HTML content that misrepresents the origin or content of the website. Users could be deceived into interacting with a seemingly legitimate website while actually being redirected to a malicious actor's page. Successful exploitation could allow attackers to perform **phishing attacks**, **credential theft**, or execute further attacks based on user interaction.

This vulnerability is especially dangerous because it does not require user privileges for exploitation, and interaction from the user (such as clicking a link) can trigger the attack.

## **Attack Vectors**
- **.PDF** documents ([source](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/void-banshee-exploits-second-microsoft-zero-day))
