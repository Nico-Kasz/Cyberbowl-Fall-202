### **Summary**

MSHTML (Microsoft HTML) is the HTML rendering engine developed by Microsoft, used primarily in ==Internet Explorer and legacy applications on Windows.== It interprets and displays HTML content, enabling users to view web pages, emails, and other HTML-based documents. MSHTML supports various web standards, including CSS, JavaScript, and ActiveX, allowing for interactive and dynamic web content. However, due to its extensive use, it has been the target of various security vulnerabilities over the years.

### **Implementation**

MSHTML is integrated into several Microsoft products, including Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office (e.g., Outlook), and Windows applications that require HTML rendering. It processes HTML documents, applies styles, executes scripts, and handles interactions within the web environment. MSHTML allows developers to create rich user experiences by leveraging standard web technologies, but its integration with older applications and protocols can lead to compatibility and security issues.

### **CVE-2024-43461 Vulnerability**

CVE-2024-43461 highlights a specific vulnerability in the MSHTML rendering engine that could allow attackers to exploit the handling of crafted web content. This vulnerability could enable attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system by tricking users into interacting with malicious web pages or files that leverage MSHTML. The flaw particularly affects legacy systems where MSHTML remains operational, even in the absence of Internet Explorer.

### **Release Date**

MSHTML has been part of Microsoftâ€™s web technologies since the release of Internet Explorer in the mid-1990s. It has undergone numerous updates to improve performance and security over the years.

### **Active Versions**

- **Windows 10**
- **Windows 11**
- **Microsoft Office applications** (e.g., Outlook)
- Legacy versions of **Internet Explorer** and other Windows applications using MSHTML
