### **Summary**

==HTA (HTML Application) files are executable files that contain HTML and scripts (such as VBScript or JScript) which are executed by the Microsoft Windows HTA host.== They are designed to provide a way to create rich desktop applications using web technologies. HTA files can leverage the full capabilities of the Windows operating system, allowing developers to create interactive applications with a GUI, while still utilizing familiar HTML/CSS for the layout.

### **Implementation**

HTA files are typically saved with a .hta file extension and can be executed by double-clicking them in Windows. ==When run, the HTA host renders the HTML content and executes any embedded scripts. Because HTA applications run with the same privileges as the user executing them, they can access system resources, modify files, and perform other tasks that regular web pages cannot. This capability makes HTA files powerful but also potentially dangerous if used maliciously.==

### **CVE-2024-43461 Vulnerability**

CVE-2024-43461 refers to a security vulnerability associated with HTA files that can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system. This vulnerability can be exploited through maliciously crafted HTA files that utilize outdated or flawed components in the Windows environment. If a user inadvertently opens a malicious HTA file, it could lead to code execution and compromise the system, making it crucial to exercise caution when dealing with HTA files from untrusted sources.

### **Release Date**

HTA files were introduced in **Windows 98** as part of Microsoft's effort to integrate web technologies into desktop applications. They have been included in subsequent versions of Windows.

### **Active Versions**

- **Windows 10**
- **Windows 11**
- Legacy versions of **Windows** that support HTA applications
