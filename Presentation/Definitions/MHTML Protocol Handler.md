### **Summary**

The MHTML (MIME HTML) protocol handler is a feature in Microsoft Windows that allows the retrieval of web pages and their resources in a single file format. MHTML files combine HTML and related resources (like images, scripts, and stylesheets) into a single MIME-encoded file, enabling easier sharing and storage of complete web pages. This protocol handler is primarily utilized by legacy applications such as Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office applications for rendering web content.

### **Implementation**

The MHTML protocol handler works by encapsulating HTML documents and associated resources into a single file with the .mht or .mhtml extension. When a user accesses an MHTML file, the handler processes the contents, enabling the display of the full webpage as intended by the original source. This is particularly useful for archiving or sending complete web pages without losing associated resources. However, as this protocol relies on older technologies, it may introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.

### **CVE-2024-43461 Vulnerability**

CVE-2024-43461 refers to a vulnerability associated with the MHTML protocol handler, which could allow attackers to exploit improperly handled MHTML files to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. This vulnerability arises from the way the handler processes URLs and MIME data, potentially leading to spoofing attacks where an attacker could trick a user into opening a malicious MHTML file that exploits the handler's flaws.

### **Release Date**

The MHTML protocol handler has been part of Microsoft Windows since its introduction, with continuous updates and enhancements over the years. Its initial implementation dates back to early versions of Internet Explorer.

### **Active Versions**

- **Windows 10**
- **Windows 11**
- **Microsoft Office applications** that utilize MHTML
- Legacy versions of **Internet Explorer**
